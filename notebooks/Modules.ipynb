    "Packages allows for structuring modules in `Python` by using \"dotted module names\". For instance, you can have a package `A`, that consists of modules `b` and `c`. These will be accessed as `A.b` and `A.c`, respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "By structuring modules within a package, one does not have to worry about conflicts between the global variable names of `b` and `c`. Additionally, often, the module collection within a pacakge, allows you to naturally differentiate between different types of capabilities. \n",

    "    - Third is to be able to apply different types of machine learning functions - classification, clustering, etc.\n",

The use of this file ensures that one can ignore certain directories that we do not intend to be treated as a package. \\_\\_init\\_\\_.py can just be an empty file, but it can also execute initialization code for the package or set the \\_\\_all\\_\\_ variable, described later.\n",
